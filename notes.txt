Useful Rules
1 - The ratio of pose limbs never changes
2 - feet can't go through the floor, and one foot is always on the floor
3 - persistent vertical lines are representative of the walls in the room
4 - the closer to the bottom of the image, the higher probability of the floor
5 - the closer to the top of the image, the higher probability of the ceiling
6 - the camera is likely at chest level
